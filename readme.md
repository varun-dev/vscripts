This project creates a package which encapsulates all the eslint configurations and dependencies to keep your project package.json clean..

`/project` - this is a demo
`/vslint` - actual package which hides stuff

From the project folder, run `npm run init`. This will do some stuff and install your dependencies including the vslint dependency...

... more documentation coming soon
